# GTO Wizard API Spec

Reverse-engineered API specification for the GTO Wizard postflop solver.

## Endpoints

GTO Wizard uses two endpoints to power the postflop solution UI:

### 1. Spot Solution — full strategy data

```
GET /{version}/solutions/spot-solution/
```

Returns the **complete GTO solution** at a decision node: strategy frequencies, expected values, ranges, blockers, and hand categories for all 1326 hand combinations. This is the heavy payload (~960KB) that powers the strategy grid and EV display.

### 2. Next Actions — lightweight navigation

```
GET /{version}/poker/next-actions/
```

Returns only the **available actions** at the next node in the game tree. No strategy arrays, no EVs — just the action list and game state metadata. Called when the user clicks an action to navigate forward.

### How they work together

```
User loads a spot
  └─► spot-solution  → full strategy data (render grid)

User clicks "Check"
  └─► next-actions   → what actions exist at the next node (render buttons)
  └─► spot-solution  → full strategy for the new node (render grid)
```

### Comparison

| | spot-solution | next-actions |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Full GTO strategy | Navigation / action list |
| **Response size** | ~960 KB | ~5 KB |
| **strategy[1326]** | Yes | No |
| **evs[1326]** | Yes | No |
| **ranges[1326]** | Yes | No |
| **blocker data** | Yes | No |
| **available actions** | Yes (inside `action_solutions`) | Yes (inside `available_actions`) |
| **game state** | Yes | Yes |
| **future_actions** | No | Yes (lookahead on street transitions) |
| **is_solution_end** | No | Yes (terminal node detection) |
| **preset_action_code** | No | Yes (UI hint for default selection) |

    6_river_ip_check/                  # After IP checks on river (showdown)
```

Each example folder contains:
- `curl.txt` — full cURL command with headers
- `payload.txt` — query parameters
- `response.json` — full JSON response

## Scenario

All examples use the same hand:

- **Format:** 8-handed MTT, 20bb effective
- **Preflop:** BTN opens to 2bb, BB calls
- **Board:** Ac Td 6h (flop) / Th (turn) / Ah (river)
- **Line:** Check-check on every street to showdown

| Endpoint | Method | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `/{version}/solutions/spot-solution/` | GET | Documented |
| `/{version}/poker/next-actions/` | GET | Documented |

## Development

**Swagger UI** (interactive docs):
```bash
npx swagger-ui-watcher openapi.yaml
```

**Mock API server** (queryable endpoints):
```bash
npx @stoplight/prism-cli mock openapi.yaml --port 3000
```

Example queries (auth headers required):
```bash
# Next Actions
curl "http://localhost:3000/v1/poker/next-actions?gametype=MTTGeneral&depth=20.125&preflop_actions=F-F-F-F-F-R2-F-C&flop_actions=X&board=AcTd6h" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test" \
  -H "gwclientid: test"

# Spot Solution
curl "http://localhost:3000/v1/solutions/spot-solution?gametype=MTTGeneral&depth=20.125&preflop_actions=F-F-F-F-F-R2-F-C&board=AcTd6h" \
